      SafeOrbit is easy-to-use and strong security toolkit for .NET and .NET Core.

      While SafeOrbit's primarly focus is strong memory protection, SafeOrbit can protect any data in the memory for you: you have SafeBytes to protect binaries, SafeString to protect texts and even more to protect your application against injections. It also provides a bunch of tools to implement strong and high performance cryptographically secure algorithms for encryption, hashing and random.
